          I reimagined the Anti-Defamation League’s campaign Imagine a World Without Hate, which poses a powerful question: 
          What if the individuals who lost their lives to hate had the chance to live out their dreams?
          The original campaign existed solely as a YouTube video, using imagined narratives to honor the lives that could have been. 
          I was drawn to this storytelling approach and wanted to translate it into a visual language that could live beyond the screen—in public spaces, on billboards, and across social media.
          <br><br>
          Through typography, I created a series of motion and print posters that juxtapose the real and imagined stories of these individuals. 
          I used strikethroughs to mark the original, tragic endings—a visual reminder of the lives cut short—while the imagined text offers a hopeful alternative. 
          The title is set in Pangaia, a serif typeface by Pangram Pangram, chosen for the warmth and embrace suggested by the shape of the letter “W.”
          <br><br>
          The overall design is minimal and type-driven, allowing the message to speak clearly and accessibly. 
          My goal was to make the campaign feel present and tangible—a call to reflect, and to imagine a world where hate doesn’t win.
